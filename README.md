# Process Simulation and Control (PSIC)

## What is PSIC
PSIC is a easy-to-use and a user-friendly Excel add-in application for both studying process dynamics and designing simple control systems, all through modeling and simulation in the time domain. It is an interactive tool for education using a well-known spreadsheet environment that has been designed to help students understand the behavior of basic chemical engineering systems and basic principles of feedback control, without the need to program in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) or to understand Laplace transformation. PSIC allows students to build dynamic simulation models of liquid storage systems, heat or mass transfer processes, chemical and biochemical reactors, and many more systems. PSIC can simulate systems consisting of up to ten ordinary differential equations of the first order (ODEs), with up to twenty-five quantities. Optionally, simulation models can be connected to a feedback PID controller into a configurable regulatory loop.
This tool has been published in [A spreadsheet‐based tool for education of chemical process simulation and control fundamentals](https://doi.org/10.1002/cae.22271).

## Example
The use of PSIC is illustrated in the simulation and control of an electrically heated water heater in the file Heater.xlsx.
