# PSIC
Process Simulation and Control (PSIC) is a easy-to-use and user-friendly Excel add-in application for both studying process dynamics and designing simple control systems, all through modeling and simulation in the time domain. It is an interactive tool for education process simulation and control fundamentals in well-known spreadsheet environment that helps beginners to understand the behavior of basic chemical-engineering systems and principles of feedback control without the need for Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming and understanding to Laplace transformation. PSIC allows building dynamic simulation models of liquid storage systems, heat or mass transfer processes, chemical and biochemical reactors and others consisting of at most ten ordinary differential equations of the first order (ODEs) with up to twenty five quantities that are numerically solved by Euler's method. Simulation models can be connected to one feedback proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller into the configurable regulatory loop.

The use of PSIC is illustrated on simulation and control of electrically-heated water heater in the file Heater.xlsx.
